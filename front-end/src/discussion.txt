What challenges did you encounter as you created this project? How did you overcome them?
1. Had to understand Routing within single page.
2. Had to rethink Context, to use it according to patterns.

Discuss your design decisions. What changes did you make from the starter code?
1. At start I coded whole app without Create-React-App. From zero. I bundled everything
myself with Webpack. However the app bundled that way exceeded 3MB. I didn't 
know how to overcome that. Moving my files to Create-React-App made it much smaller.
2. I used Formik as form framework, which I consider excellent. I added Yup as 
validation engine.

Did you create a form component? Why or why not?
1. Yes, called CashierForm. 
Works like a cashier, accepts or gives the money. Based on Configuration
It's a single form that encapsulates cash-in and cash-out.

What extra features or enhancements did you build?
1. Added LocalStorage, to store user changes.
2. Also added a choice of a user we'd like to operate on.
